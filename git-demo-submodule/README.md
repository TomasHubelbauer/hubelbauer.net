# Git Demo Submodule

This repository is used to demonstrate Git submodules.

It can be added to another repository as a submodule like so:

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/git-demo-submodule
```

This line is reserved for making changes to the demo submodule in case that is
needed to test the submodule is working in the supermodule as expected.
Just flip the arrow below to the opposite direction and make a new commit here.
