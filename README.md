This repository hosts my personal website.

## Pipelines

This repository has a few pipelines associated with it and they periodicaly
check the GitHub Pages custom domain setup, including the for [apex] domain and
the [www][www] subdomain, HTTP to HTTPS redirect and LE SSL certificate.

[apex]: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain
[www]: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain-and-the-www-subdomain-variant

## To-Do

### Wait for the DNS changes to go live and check that apex, WWW and HTTPS work

Once this all works out, both the apex and subdomain variants should work and
hopefully the HTTPS setup will remain intact.
